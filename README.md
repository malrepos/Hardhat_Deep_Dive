# Hardhat Deep Dive

Hardhat is an essential tool for any aspiring web3 developer. Currently Hardhat is the dominant deployment and testing tool for smart contracts. When learning Hardhat, initial syntax may be a little confusing. Also, Hardhat comes with a lot of functionality under the hood, and given that we are engaging with this through the command line, some of this may be missed or not use to it's fullest.

This deep dive aims to get an intermediate developer comfortable with the syntax of set up and deployment of smart contracts, as well as testing. I do this by working through a lot of examples, gradually adding functionality and complexity as we progress.
